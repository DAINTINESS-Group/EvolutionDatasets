# Schema Evolution Datasets (2019)

A collection of datasets to facilitate the study of Schema Evolution. Each dataset refers to the history of a database schema as a sequence of releases. Wherever available, contextual information for this history are also published. For more explanations and findings, please refer to the [Schema Biographies](http://www.cs.uoi.gr/~pvassil/projects/schemaBiographies/index.html) site.

The folders contain:
- The documentation, including the experimental method and the extraction process in full detail	
- The data, i.e., the schema histories of 195 projects, as extracted in May 2019
- The results, including Excel files, and summary statistics for all the studied projects
