Please, remove the part that realurl can make a different url when the user is logged in. This information is false and only confuses people. Realurl converts urls provided by TYPO3 as is, without any relation to logged in users. It cannot do anything special if the user is logged in or not.

If TYPO3 did not provide any additional parameters when the user is logged in, realurl cannot do anything special.

If TYPO3 provides additional parameters in the url when the user is logged in, url will be unique also without realurl. So realurl should not be mentioned here at all."

found a bug when adding a new content element by BE-module ""New Content Element"".

Setting:
- Adding the element with the module ""New Content Elemente"" results in field image orientation with odd settings:
  A) Selectbox-icons do not match with Seletbox-options; it's od
  B) Given Defaultvalue in TSConfig-Usergroup is ignored. Same to page ts config
- Using decimated entries in imageorientation by TS config (page):
  TCEFORM.tt_content.imageorient.removeItems = 17, 18
- Using default value on TS User Config
  TCAdefaults.tt_content.layout = 52
  TCAdefaults.tt_content.imageorient = 25

Behavior:
- The settings work when adding new content element by right-click on extisting CE, new CE; the new content element opens directly with type of default CE-type; all default values are correct, image orient selectbox options match the selectbox icons consistently
- The settings work NOT when adding new content by clicking on ""+ content""-button or other ways calling the ""New Content Element""-page allowing the user to select the CE-type by tabs & descriptions & icons; after that, the behavior of image orient is odd: default value is ignored, selectbox option does not match selectbox icons (means: clicking on a selectbox icon brings a different text and icon as selected option => umatching)

--> Strange; 

This avoids consistent usage for predefined author roles / ways of useage: author has to care about image orient and other things."

On the other hand, the ""license"" topic of TYPO3 docs pops up every now and then.

Unfortunately, I am not a lawyer and I can't assess the pros and cons and impacts. Additionally, it looks like nobody is really interested in following up on this or can provide good advices.

Nevertheless, I dare to ask the question again: should we simply correct the links and stick with the Open Content License or should be consider choosing a new license?"

Scenario: An instance under load with lots of TS records that are changed on live directly. While this is often an unwanted scenario, it still may happen for ""microsites"" instances - lots of sites with small page trees. The clearCacheCmd('all') fired by the TypoScript module is then disadvantegous, since it kills way too many cache entries where only entries of the page with the TS record and all its children should be cleared.

The solution to just disable the page clear however is not sufficient, since caches of subpages are not cleared, so the proposed solution is only useful if pages with a changed TS record have no sub pages.

More general approach: Tag a fe cache entry with its rootline. So if a cache entry belongs to page 42 which is a child of page 23 and that is a child of page 5, then page 42 cache entry would be tagged with ""isChildOf_23"" and ""isChildOf_5"" (or similar). The change the TS module to not fire clearCacheCmd('all'), but clearCacheCmd('cacheTag:isChildOf_5') if TS record of page 5 is changed. clearCacheCmd can do that already. Cache entry for page 23 and 42 would be cleared then. Also flush by tag ""PageId_5"". If done, exactly the correct cache entries would be killed and nothing more.
It may only happen that if you ""flushByTag"" a page that alredy has lots of sub pages takes quite some time, so in this case it may be quicker to just ""flush whole cache"" - this does a truncate on Typo3DbBackend cache and an rm -r on file caches and is much quicker than a lengthy ""delete nearly everything"". So, we'd probably need PageTS that controls the flush behaviour (with default to flushByTag).

Tagging caches in the frontend with its ""rootline"" could be beneficial for other things as well, maybe for the list/page module for example: Eg. storing a record on a storage page X then triggers a ""clear caches of page Y and Z and all their sub pages, which is currently also not possible.

Todo:
Find out if the above solution is sane and do-able.
Add functionality to add ""rootline"" tags to cache_pages in the frontend.
Find out usage of pagesection and see if this one can be tagged as well or if the cache entries are re-used on different pages again - which may torpedo the above idea.
Find a sane pageTS syntax to feed clearCacheCmd with options like 'kill everthing below ""me""' and implement it.
I'm not 100% sure if the above will survive all checks, but it sounds like a good idea to me. Better tagging in the frontend is long overdue anyway and it may help us at other places as well. I've raised some attention towards this issue to some active contributors already (eg. Markus Klein and Helmut Hummel), we think that this issue could probably be solved this way, but at the moment no one is really digging deep into that and actually working on it - this is one reason why an answer took longer, I'm really sorry for that.

Alexander, what do you think, is this a good idea and are you feeling you could dive into this overall topic and search for progress here? I would happily help with providing more information, ideas and technical insights that I have on my radar - eg. I know the caching framework pretty well, but I don't know the FE details on my own without digging myself.

I know that the proposed solution is much more complex than just disabling the clear cache action, but I really think this would go into the right direction. My gut feeling is this would be do-able and won't end in ""complexity hell"", cache_pages should be fine, my only doubts are regarding sub cache layers like pagesection, those should get an eye first.

This is the case for instance when a screenshot is created on a retina-enabled machine such as a recent MBP where PNG screenshots have a native resolution of 144 dpi instead of 72.

When the pixel density is properly stored within the image, pdflatex is using it to properly resize the image accordingly but since #62597 we take for granted that every image is 72 dpi, and resize them to 50%. This makes higher resolution images appear too small.

According to http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Comp/comp.text.tex/2008-05/msg00624.html it should be possible to read the actual image resolution during rendering and change the resize factor dynamically instead of hardcoding it to 50%.

I would recommend to include images whose resolution is > 72 dpi at a 1:1 ratio without any dynamic computation. This would let the user choose the actual resolution (think of 300 dpi images for instance).

**Note 1:** see instructions ""here"":http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2010/02/the-myth-of-dpi/ on how changing the resolution in Photoshop without altering the pixel size.

**Note 2:** Although the previous article states that PNG do not hold dpi, this problem has been found with a PNG, maybe the info is only true if the image was saved for the web in Photoshop."

However, currently images are often displaced by several paragraphs; I even found some, which were displaced for several _pages_.

The generated LaTeX files have figures in them like so:
<pre>
\begin{figure}[htbp]
...
\end{figure}
</pre>

The values behind the word ""figure"" tell the LaTeX renderer how it should render the image:
h=here
t=top of next page
b=bottom of page
p=somewhere later on a page together with other images

All these values do _not_ place the images the way we want. Even only using ""h"" still does not always place the image directly where it belongs. This can also not be fixed by using ""!h"" like so: @\begin{figure}[!h]@. ""!h"" strongly suggests LaTeX to really put the image where it has been found. However, should it for some reason not fit at that exact place, LaTeX will float following text above the image, which again displaces it. 

Using @\begin{figure}[H]@ finally _does_ position images correctly. In my tests this was the _only_ way to get images placed properly (tested with the CoreAPIReference). 

This value can be set in conf.py in the latex_elements section:
<pre>
'figure_align': 'H'
</pre>
""Docs"":http://sphinx.readthedocs.org/en/latest/config.html#options-for-latex-output

In order for this option (""H"") to work, we need to use the package ""float"" in the tex file like so:
<pre>
\usepackage{float}
</pre>

However, our version of sphinx (version 1.2pre) does not yet support the ""figure_align"" option. We will have to update sphinx to a current version in order to get support for it. ""This is the commit we want."":https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx/commits/0f18c81b53fcaa4db81afaa2d5cf7c32edde93b9 (not yet released)

In the meantime we can fix this by modifying the generated tex file, e.g. with @sed@ from inside cron_rebuild.sh:
<pre>
    sed -i"""" 's/\\usepackage{typo3}/\\usepackage{float}\n\\usepackage{typo3}/' $BUILDDIR/latex/$PROJECT.tex

Readability for printing optionally could be improved by setting @ocgcolorlinks@ for the hyperlinks package like so:

This option could then be given when loading hyperref. Note that you cannot give it in \hypersetup. However, in _my_ opinion setting @ocgcolorlinks@ is not necessary at all.

Instead the links should always point to the central Index.html file. The link to the rst file (which points to the _source/ folder) should be removed; the singlehtml version does not come with a _source/ folder currently.

For the PDF version neither the target in the source files nor in the PDF is linked; either fix the links to point to the accoring label in the PDF (more or less like the TOC does) or I would tend to just leaving the directive out in the PDF files.

60184,Inside TYPO3,Bug,"",New,Should have,TYPO3 4.5: CSH for FlexForms,Chris topher,"",2014-07-08 14:39,"","",2014-07-08,"","",0,2014-07-08 14:30,"","",1752450,"","","(Text ""by François"":http://wiki.typo3.org/wiki/index.php?title=Pending_Documentation&diff=54163&oldid=prev .)

CSH for FlexForms is handled more cleanly but requires adjustments. This has an impact in particular for FE plugins. To continue displaying<br> the CSH for their FlexForm, the CSH file must be declared as for other elements, i.e. 
<pre> t3lib_extMgm::addLLrefForTCAdescr('somekey', 'EXT:myext/locallang_csh.xml');</pre> 
The key is defined as follows: 
<pre>[table name].[field name].[DS pointer field 1](.[DS pointer field 2])</pre> 
The table and the field are those where the FlexForm is used. In most cases this will be ""tt_content.pi_flexform"". The next elements of the key (still separated with dots) are the values of the field or fields (there may be only one) defined in the ""ds_pointerField"" property for the TCA of the FlexForm field. In the case of plugin options, the ""ds_pointerField"" property is set to ""list_type,CType"", so the key would be of the form:<br> 
<pre>tt_content.pi_flexform.[value of list_type field].list
</pre> 
""list"" being the value of the CType field for a FE plugin. To give a complete example, let's assume that the plugin used is from the ""comments"" extension, the full key will be:<br> 
<pre>tt_content.pi_flexform.comments_pi1.list
</pre> 
because ""comments_pi1"" is the value found in the field ""list_type"" when using the plugin provided by the ""comments"" extension. So the ""comments"" extension would use the following call to register its FlexForm CSH:<br> 
<pre>t3lib_extMgm::addLLrefForTCAdescr('tt_content.pi_flexform.comments_pi1.list', 'EXT:comments/pi1/locallang_csh.xml');
</pre> 
With this new method, it is not necessary anymore to point to the CSH&nbsp;file from within the FlexForm's DS, though the ""cshFile"" tag should be left for compatibility with older versions of TYPO3. 

On top of the above, it is advised (but not required) to use the ""alttitle"" in the CSH structure intensively, as it will improve the information displayed in the help pop-up window. In particular, don't forget to define the ""general alttitle"" which is used at the top of the window. Example: 
<pre>&lt;label index="".alttitle""&gt;My plugin's cool configuration options&lt;/label&gt;</pre>

*Slide 11:* Install Tool was not rewritten in ?Extbase?
Install Tool is based on no framework at all, but it uses Fluid. First bullet point should read ?Re-developed from scratch using Fluid?.

*Slide 19:* Configuration Presets have nothing to do with Application Contexts
Truth is, that the Application Context cannot be set in the Install Tool; only through environment variables. The ?Presets? are just a shortcut for configuring certain TYPO3_CONF_VAR settings. This means, headline and first bullet point are wrong. See attached screenshot for an updated version of the slide (English version).

*Slide 50:* EXT:filemetadata
The English version states (in brackets): ?extension is installed but not loaded by default?, which is not 100% accurate. Sentence should read: ?extension is shipped with the core, but not installed by default?.

*Slides 101 and 103:* ?protected? flag is no longer part of a Packages.php
The ?protected? flag is no longer part of a file ?Packages.php?, which means, second bullet point on slide 101 is wrong and should be updated: ?If extension is required, a 'protected' flag is to be set in the composer.json file?. This also results in a code update on slide 103.

*Slide 103:* new code example
The naming of the composer packages has changed and is now prefixed ?typo3/cms-?, rather than ?typo3/cms/?. The updated code example on slide 103 already takes this into account.

*Slide 104:* remove this slide
Slide 104 can be dropped, as file ?Package.php? is now optional (for performance reasons).

*Slide 109:* Controller was renamed to ?LanguageController?
Due to the fact that the controller was renamed to ?LanguageController?, the following two changes should be made:

h2. First part of the problem

There is data, which has been created _before_ 20060102213759 (2.1.2006). 

h3. Entries in the text table

In the text table, these are text entries with @old_id <= 20962@ (timestamp of the revision with old_id = 20962: 20051021095634). They are _not_ marked as ""utf-8"".
The next entry has old_id = 21714 (timestamp of the associated revision: 20060102213759). This and all newer entries _do have_ the utf-8 flag.

h3. Entries in the archive table

This also needs a check in the archive table:

There are 1258 rows, which do _not_ point to a ar_text_id (ar_text_id IS NULL).

The ""utf-8"" flag is _not_ set in ar_flags.

 SELECT * FROM revision where
 rev_timestamp > 20090711133645 # = rev_id 46246 - bis dahin ist's defintiv kaputt
 and rev_timestamp < 20090731062345 # = rev_id 46317 - ab da ist's OK
 limit 0, 200;
</code>

Inbetween are 62 revs from 11. July to 31. July.

I pick rev_id 46290; after that Daniel did several changes, which point to updates/bug fixes in the wiki being done. rev_id 46290 (timestamp 20090729151633) is the one I take as border between good and bad revs. 

20090729151633 then also is the border for the value of ar_timestamp in the archive table.


Data older than that shows wrong encoding e.g. in edit comments and such.

The way the encoding is broken is the same here as for the very old data (data created _before_ 20060102213759 = the part affected by problem 1). The fix for this part of the problem must be applied for the very first entries up to 20090729151633.

The fields that need checking (old fields up to date x):
* edit comments
* image descriptions and so on....

h2. Solution approach

This problem happens when UTF-8-encoded data is displayed as latin1. However, we _do display_ that data as _UTF-8_, so it must miss one conversion to latin1.
Our content is in columns with binary encoding. This means MySQL functions, which convert encodings won't change anything with it, as - for MySQL - it currently _does not have_ any encoding. Something like the following double-convert can be used to convert them anyway:

<code class=""sql"">

1) the slide is +empty+, when the PDF document is generated the first time. If you change to the output directory and run the @pdflatex@ command again, the overview is generated correctly. I assume, because some files are generated at the first run and the second run uses them in order to generate the overview.

This is not a show stopper for the final ""What's New"" versions (in all languages), because we can simply run the LaTeX-to-PDF rendering twice (manually) for the versions, which then get published. However, this means, during development, the slide is empty.

2) if the slide is generated (at the second run), it does not show the TYPO3 ""Share"" font but something like ""Arial"" or so. Also, the alignment looks a little bit weird.

We use the LaTeX class *tableofcontents* for generating the chapter overview, so I assume, this needs to be tweaked somehow."

And update screenshots (e.g. because of visible version number).

And update these two places on the page In-Depth->The Install Tool, where it suddenly starts speaking about ""if you did *not* use the 1-2-3 installer, then you have to do this and that"" (e.g. fill database tables and create admin user). Remove these notes! The manual currently ""only"" documents starting with the 1-2-3 installer. It does not document starting without it at all!

1) Improvement: the background color of the admonitions should be set to white. I tested locally and adding ""background-color: #ffffff;"" to "".doc .admonition"". Without this admonitions look weird when on a gray background (which happens inside definition list tables; for example, see http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/TCAReference/Reference/Ctrl/Index.html and search for ""typeicon_column"").

2) Bug fix: the CSS from typo3.org has the following selector:
<pre>
.d ol li {
    position: relative;
    padding-left: 20px;
    list-style: decimal;
}
</pre>
The ""list-style"" breaks nested lists when you switch from OL to UL. This is rather rare, but does happen here, for example: http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/indexed_search/latest/AnalysingIndexedData/Index.html

We need to add something like:
<pre>
.d ol ul li {
    list-style-type: disc
}
</pre>
or remove that weird ""list-style: decimal;"" value.

Furthermore nested lists don't display well due to the fixed padding. We need to add something like:
<pre>
.d ol li li {
    padding-left: 20px;
}

I would do this myself, but I couldn't find the CSS files. Are they not stored in Git?"

On occasion of this the ""T3PythonDocBuilder"" was modernized. See the ChangeLog.txt:

2013-06-25

    Add ChangeLog.txt for ./T3PythonDocBuilder.
    Introduce constants.py to keep common constants.
    Bump version number of ooxhtml2rst.py to __version__ = '1.2.0'.

    Refer to ""docs.typo3.org"" instead of ""preview.docs.typo3.org""
    in the template.

    Do not write ""DEFINE SOME TEXTROLES"" any more in each ReST-file.
    Add "".. include:: [../]Includes.txt in each ReST-file.

    Do not create ReST version of type ""flt"" with directive 
    "".. field-list-table::"" anymore (but still "".. t3-field-list-table::"").

    Prepend all sections with a label. Only sections made up by just
    underlining are covered.
    
    Add the Includes.txt file.
    Add the Targets.rst file.
    
    Tweak the ""dllisttables(.py)"". These are the ""definition list
    structures"" that are produced from the original ""property tables"" of
    the OpenOffice documents. Tweaking means: drop the first table row
    it is meaningless. Add a headline and label for each row.
        
    
2013-05-24 wishlist:

    go through the file structure (starting at Documentation)
    record the depth level
    in each file:
     remove the text role header
     add the include directive (with respect to depth)
     for each section heading
      add a label before it. Base the label on the section heading text.
     read t3-field-list-table structures
     for each such structure
      remove the first row
      for each other row
       repeat the t3-field-list-table declaration
       add a section heading before it (with a label) based on the property's (first field) name

[31-May-2013 14:23:32] PHP Fatal error:  Call to a member function idForName() on a non-object in index_sso.php on line 140

(This problem was already present with MediaWiki 1.20; it is _not_ caused by the update to 1.21.)

Our login script does this:
<code class=""php"">
	$user = User::newFromName($User_Name);
	$id = $user->idForName(); /* line 140 */
</code>

The second line is the one causing the error.

*Background:*

@User::newFromName@ usually returns an object and everything is fine.
But in _some rare cases_ it does _not_ return an object, which then causes the error when trying to do @$user->idForName();@ (as @$user@ is no object then).
The problematic cases are:
* The username contains ""#""
* The username contains forbidden characters: Certain unicode signs, slashes (would break subpage-concept of MediaWiki), slash-dot-combinations, control characters, the sequence ""~~~""
* The username starts with an interwiki prefix or a namespace, e.g. ""de:xxx"" or ""File:xxx"".
* The user page would not be creatable (reasons partly similar to the ones above), e.g. ""/../"" in a user name would make the user page inaccessable due to the way how browsers handle relative URLs.

*Non-solutions:*

We could start modifying the username in order to make it valid for MediaWiki, but we should not do that. Would we do that, we would have lost: If we modify usernames, we cannot be sure that there is not another user, who already *has* that username. The two would then no longer be distinguishable. They would appear to be one and the same user.

*Solution:*

Make the script not fail with a fatal PHP error, but make it fail at least a bit more gracefully:

<code class=""php"">
$user = User::newFromName( $username );
if ( !is_object( $user ) ) {
       echo 'Invalid username. We are sorry, but your username cannot be used by MediaWiki. ' .
           'It contains signs/combinations of signs, which cannot be used.';
       die();
}
$id = $user->idForName();
</code>

The script is derived from ""createAndPromote.php"":https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/gitweb?p=mediawiki/core.git;a=blob;f=maintenance/createAndPromote.php;h=81fbbb3d3246042ca671b6c4d0ba3f2a2e0204d1;hb=refs/heads/REL1_21.
They basically do the same:
<code class=""php"">
$user = User::newFromName( $username );
if ( !is_object( $user ) ) {
          $this->error( ""invalid username."", true );
}

$exists = ( 0 !== $user->idForName() );
...
</code>
@$this->error( ""invalid username."", true );@ prints the error message and then calls @die()@ as well."

Dear Typoscript documentation team,

I was just following your Typoscript in 45 minutes tutorial and found an mistake in an example (or at least it didn't work for me). In the 4th blue code box on the following page: http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/TyposcriptIn45MinutesTutorial/Typoscript-AQuickOverview/FirstSteps/Index.html

The example states the following: 

# <= means that the object is referenced (the object is linked)
 test.value = Holla
 mypage.10 <= test


but instead it should be the following: 

# =< means that the object is referenced (the object is linked)
 test.value = Holla
 mypage.10 =< test

The operator sign <= should be =<. 

Good luck and best regards,
Refik Hadzialic

Ok now we have these wrong examples (wrong means, that a comment on the right side is wrong)

Here we are:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dummy.enable = # false, because value is empty
dummy.enable = 0 # false, prefered notation
dummy.enable = 1 # true, prefered notation
dummy.enable = yes # true, because ('yes') is a non empty string and not treated as '0'
dummy.enable = no # true (!), because ('no') is a non empty string and not treated as '0'
dummy.enable = 0 anything # false, because ('0 anything') is treated as '0'
dummy.enable = 1 anything # false, because ('1 anything') is treated as '1'
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the comment of this excample:
dummy.enable = yes # true, because ('yes') is a non empty string and not treated as '0'
says that something is not treated as '0' and thereby this result is told to us:
dummy.enable = true

the comment of the last excample:
dummy.enable = 1 anything # false, because ('1 anything') is treated as '1'
says also that something is not treated as '0' - but another result is told to us:
dummy.enable = false

I repeat my first posting for this issue: 
The comment of the examples before the last one say that something is _true_ when the value is not treated as '0'.
The comment of the last example _still_ says that something is _false_ when the value is not treated as '0' (e.g. when it is treated as '1')
 - so this comment says the opposite of all comments before.

My original intention of closed issue #44813 was not to _reduce_ examples, it was to publish _correct_ examples.

Please do not tell the readers that
dummy.enable = 1 anything 
is 
dummy.enable = false
because it is
dummy.enable = true

The solution is to make the page show up in the menu, open the page and hide it again.

<pre>
Hi,

our CGL currently state that inline comments must be indented one tab more than the following code line.

This is a speciality that only exists (as far as I know) in the TYPO3 project for historical reasons.

One downside is, that IDEs lack support for auto formatting the comments that way.

With the switch to namespaces, the script accidently reverted this coding style and set *all* inline comments on the same indenation level as the following code.

During the CI code sprint we discussed if it would make sense to change the CGL here and leave it, as we have it now instead of fixing all the comments.

We all agreed that we should go that way and change the CGLs

Any major downsides to do so?

Kind regards,
Helmut

However, some screenshots cannot be made with Fireshot, e.g. because an open drop down box should be shown. When you click the FireShot icon and even when you only press the keyboard shortcut for it, the drop down box gets closed before the image is made, so that you cannot show the content of the drop down box.
** *Causing the problem*: Make screenshot with ""Print Screen"" button on the keyboard, paste to Photoshop, cut it, etc, *copy to clipboard*. When this is pasted in OpenOffice/LibreOffice, the result is an SVM file.
** *Preventing the problem*: Everything as above, but do _not_ copy to clipboard. Instead in Photoshop *save as PNG*. This file can then be dragged into the document with the mouse or it can be inserted using the Insert > Picture > From File dialogue in Writer. Then the result still is a PNG file."

TCA ['ctrl'] section

The documentation of ""type"" key needs to be extended:

It is also possible to reference fields from related records, i.e. switch by the typeField of a foreign table. For doing so, you can use the syntax relationField:foreignTypeField.

Example: If you have two tables, parent and child table. The child table has a relation to the parent table using a ""select"" field called ""myparent"" with ""foreign_table"" set to the parent table. Now, if you want the fields displayed in the child table to depend on a field called ""parenttype"" on the parent table, you can define the [ctrl][type] of the child table like ""myparent:parenttype""."

If set, then this palette will never be shown, but the fields of the palette are technically rendered as hidden elements in the TCEForm. This is sometimes useful when you want to set a field's value by JavaScript from another user-defined field. You can also use it along with the IRRE (TCA type ""inline"") foreign_selector feature if you don't want the relation field to be displayed (it must be technically present and rendered though, that's why you should put it to a hidden palette in that case).

The patch adds basically the same match fields functionality, which was previously already possible for ""select"" and ""group"" fields now also to the field type ""inline"".

In the select fields documentation, it is documented like this:

MM_match_fields
array
Array of field=>value pairs to both insert and match against when writing/reading MM relations


Now, for the ""inline"" field type, it should read like this:

----------------
foreign_match_fields
array
Array of field=>value pairs to both insert and match against when writing/reading IRRE relations. Using the match fields, it is possible to re-use the same child table in more than one field of the parent table by using a match field with different values for each of the use cases.

Example: Imagine you have a parent table called ""company"" and a child table called ""persons"". Now, if you want the company table to have two fields of type ""inline"", one called ""employees"" and one called ""customers"", both containing ""persons"". Then you could use a (hidden) field called ""role"" on the child (person) table to keep them apart. The match TCA configuration of the parent table would then look like this:

<pre>
Example:
$TCA['ty_myext_company'] = array (
	...
	'columns' => array (
		...
		'employees' => array (
			'config' => array (
				'type' => 'inline',
				'foreign_table' => 'ty_myext_person',
				'foreign_field' => 'company',
				'foreign_match_fields' => array(
					'role' => 'employee',
				),
			),
		),
		'customers' => array (
			'config' => array (
				'type' => 'inline',
				'foreign_table' => 'ty_myext_person',
				'foreign_field' => 'company',
				'foreign_match_fields' => array(
					'role' => 'customer',
				),
			),
		),
	),

The stdWrap property filelink (= function filelink) has a property called @icon_thumbSize@.

*Property:* icon_thumbSize
*Data type:* string /stdWrap

*Description:*
Defines the size of the preview image.
That is the value of the ""&size="" parameter in the scr attribute inside the img tag, which links to ""t3lib/thumbs.php""
""icon"" needs to be set for the option to take effect.
File extension of the image file must be part of ""icon_image_ext_list"".
""iconCObject"" may not be set.

One and two values are possible, see the examples:
Examples:
icon_thumbSize = 150
icon_thumbSize = 40x40
The second produces an image tag like:
EXAMPLE STILL UNTESTED!
<img src=""../../../thumbs.php?&dummy=...&file=login.gif&size=40x40&md5sum=..."">


It is defined in typo3/sysext/cms/tslib/class.tslib_content.php, function filelink().

For numberFormat all three properties have stdWrap. The problem is that stdWrap cannot work correctly there.

That is the code of the function (from master):
<pre>
function numberFormat($content, $conf) {
	$decimals = isset($conf['decimals.'])
		? $this->stdWrap($conf['decimals'], $conf['decimals.'])
		: $conf['decimals'];
	$dec_point = isset($conf['dec_point.'])

	$thousands_sep = isset($conf['thousands_sep.'])

		: $conf['thousands_sep'];
	return number_format($content, $decimals, $dec_point, $thousands_sep);
}
</pre>

According to the ""PHP manual"":http://de.php.net/manual/en/function.number-format.php using stdWrap will lead to several misbehaviours (which I also experienced when testing that):
* ""decimals"" cannot be a string, so that wrapping it is not possible at all. That is why trying to set a string via @.decimals.wrap = TEST | END@ results in ""Warning: number_format() expects parameter 2 to be long, string given in ...typo3\sysext\cms\tslib\class.tslib_content.php on line 4302""
* For ""thousands_sep"" only the first sign will be used.
* For ""dec_point"" only the first _byte_.

Under these circumstances I don't really see a sense in using stdWrap there and I don't see how stdWrap could be fixed for these properties, but I see that it will create several problems when you set it.
That is why I have _not_ added stdWrap to the docs.

specifically set $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['BE']['forceCharset'] and
$TYPO3_CONF_VARS['BE']['setDBinit'] in your localconf.php. An Upgrade Wizard
will help you with that.

Christian, 2009-08-31 #20955

2.8 LOCALISATION -> Overriding LOCAL_LANG values 

<pre>TYPO3 offers an API for overriding LOCAL_LANG values by custom XML files. Provided that the inclusion of the locallang file is handled by the language class then your custom file will be included after the real locallang file(s) and the arrays will be merged together. Let's look at an example:

Example

We want to change the label of the logout button from ""Logout"" to ""End session"". What we do is this:
1. First, find out where in the XML code the label is output so that you know the label key and locallang file. In this case the script ""alt_menu.php"" outputs the button which is generated by a function from the file ""class.alt_menu_functions.inc"". Looking into this file we find that the line ""$LANG->sL('LLL:EXT:lang/locallang_core.xml:buttons.logout')"" fetches the label for the button.

2. Create an alternative XML file with the labelkeys you want to override (in our case ""buttons.logout""). I have created the file ""typo3conf/langoverride_core.xml"" which looks like this:
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8"" standalone=""yes"">
<T3locallang>
    <data type=""array"">
        <languageKey index=""default"" type=""array"">
            <label index=""buttons.logout"">End session</label>
        </languageKey>
        <languageKey index=""dk"" type=""array"">
            <label index=""buttons.logout"">Afslut session</label>
        </languageKey>
    </data>
</T3locallang>

Notice how it contains both an English and Danish label.

3. Configure the script to override values in the file ""EXT:lang/locallang_core.xml"" This is simply done by adding an entry in the $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['SYS']['locallangXMLOverride'] array which points to the overriding file:
$TYPO3_CONF_VARS['SYS']['locallangXMLOverride']['EXT:lang/locallang_core.xml']['myLangOverride'] = 'typo3conf/langoverride_core.xml';

The file path of ""typo3conf/langoverride_core.xml"" is relative to the PATH_site constant. You can also keep the file in an extension. In that case you would have to enter the file reference like 'EXT:myext/langoverride_core.xml' - and the file will automatically be found wherever your extension is installed.

The name of the array key 'myLangOverride' is arbitrary, but you are advised to give it a meaningful (and unique) value.

Additionally in the frontend it is also possible to override labels with the Typoscript key ""_LOCAL_LANG"". This takes precedence over locallangXMLOverride labels.
</pre> 

*Change the word ''XLLfile'' in 2.8 LOCALISATION -> Including locallang files in modules to ''locallangXMLOverride''. 
*Add the following paragraph somewhere:
<pre>Note: Using the array $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['BE']['XLLoverride'] is deprecated and should not be done anymore. $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['SYS']['locallangXMLOverride'] is more flexible and also works for the frontend.</pre>

  How and When To Deprecate APIs
  Here are some general rules on how to remove existing functions or parameters from TYPO3. Generally, functions or parameters are removed two major versions after they were set to be deprecated.
  
  If you want to remove a parameter of a TYPO3 core function, please note it within the phpDoc param part:
  
  /**
   * ...
   * @param	string	DEPRECATED since TYPO3 4.X - is not used anymore because...
   * ... 
   */
  
  For removing a whole function in one of the TYPO3 core classes, you can use the phpDoc @deprecated parameter. Use it like this:
  
  /**
   * ...
   * @return...
   * @deprecated since TYPO3 4.X - is not used anymore, use FUNCNAME instead 
   */
  
  The release-manager of version TYPO3 4.X+2 will remove deprecated parameters or functions then.
