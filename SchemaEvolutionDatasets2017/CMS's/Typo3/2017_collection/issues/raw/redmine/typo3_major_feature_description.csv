=============================================

Writing tables when documenting is generally not easy. ReST has markup constructs named ""simple table""; ""grid table"" and ""csv-table"". None of them really fit our needs as we have big; largely nested tables in our OpenOffice manuals. Often one table cell contains as much text as it makes a complete document elsewhere.

As a possible solution I implemented and proposed an extension to the Docutils (basic ReST tools). Sphinx builds on this and works on top of this. Due to lack of manpower this ""field-list-table"" directive didn't make it into the Docutils core for now and therefore is mostly not available.

Now that we have made a lot of progress with the migration process to ReST in the TYPO3 community we see that rendering will be either done on a TYPO3 server or; if locally as well; always by using Sphinx. That is a good thing; as Sphinx offers an API to hook in Sphinx Extensions.

The current implementation of the ""field-list-table"" directive is entangled with the classes of the Docutils code. But I should be able to change that.

This means:
I'll try to rewrite the ""field-list-table"" directive as Sphinx extension and make that available in our Python package ""t3sphinx"" which does what the folder name says: ""ExtendingSphinxForTypo3""."

It already looks like TYPO3(.org) in many ways - but not completely. And there are a lot of usability problems with the current HTML output from that theme. See http://preview.docs.typo3.org/TYPO3/ for examples.

So the tasks are:
- improve the ""typo3sphinx"" theme
- find a rendering that can be integrated into typo3.org

It would be very helpful for editors to see an overview of the labels that are defined in a documentation project.

Here we introduce a new directive which does exactly that. It inserts a list of ref targets into the document. The directive doesn't know any options or parameters:

    .. ref-targets-list::

[Proudly presenting:] This is achieved by the Sphinx extension 't3sphinx.ext.targets'. It is included automatically due to GlobalSettings.py. To achieve that at home you have to reinstall 't3sphinx':

    $ git clone git://git.typo3.org/Documentation/RestTools.git
    $ cd ..../ExtendingSphinxForTYPO3
    $ python setup.py install

Note:
I hope I've understood the inner working of Sphinx well enough and everything works as expected. If not - let me know in this bug tracker!
