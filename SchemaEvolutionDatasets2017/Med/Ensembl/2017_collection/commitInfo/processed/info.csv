/   Can now support oligonucleotide microarrays other than Affy.
    The three affy_* tables are changed to oligo_* tables. New fields are:
      oligo_array.type (currently either AFFY or OLIGO)
      oligo_probe.length
      oligo_probe.description
    The existing Affy objects become subclasses of new Oligo objects, but
    the API is backwards compatible, so existing pipeline and Web code won't
    need changing.
