Schema Evolution Datasets (2017)
================================

A collection of datasets to facilitate the study of Schema Evolution. Each dataset refers to the history of a database schema as a sequence of releases. Wherever available, contextual information for this history are also published. For more explanations and findings, please refer to 
http://www.cs.uoi.gr/~pvassil/projects/schemaBiographies/index.html

The current collection of these data has been compiled and processed by Athanasios (Thanos) Pappas, during February 2017.

The first collection and processing of these data was performed by Ioannis Skoulis, in 2013. Unless explicitly stated otherwise (the names of the folders are indicative), the data collected refer to this version. Please refer-to/cite the following paper:
