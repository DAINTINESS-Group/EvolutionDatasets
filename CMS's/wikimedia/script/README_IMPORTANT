ATTENTION: the script do NOT check for existing DB, that would be removed/overwritten in case of name clashing!

REQUIREMENTS:
 - bash
 - svn client environment
 - mysql client environment


QUICK TUTORIAL:

	CONFIGURATION: configure in the config.ini files the URL of the schema in the SVN you want to access and the user/pass credentials if needed, 
                       configure also mysql host,port,user,pass and the basename for the DB you are installing

	USAGE: there three scripts:
		- download.sh: downloads all the revisions of the specified schema file (SQL dump of the schema)

		- createDB.sh: create the one DB for each revision of the schema and load the schema
	
		- dropDB.sh: clean up the MySQL DBMS from the installation of the DB (all revisions)
		
		- stats.sh: compute basic statistics in on the install data (querying the information_schema)

		- cleanup.sh: remove all the temporary results (do not reset your config.ini file)
